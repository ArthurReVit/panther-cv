# Panther CV

## About Panther CV

This project aims to create an open source CV template allowing users to easily upload their data into a nice and customizable website.

Right now, everything will be static since my first goal is to have a website that I can share in my Linkedin profile.

As this project grows, I will integrate the following features:

- API integration, allowing users to hold their data in a custom Database.
- Administration panel allowing users to create, read, update, delete, hide and customize how their data is shown.
- Customization panel, allowing users to change the site's colours, distributions an typography.

For more information about this project, you can contact me at desarrollo.web_arturo@outlook.com.

## Contributing

This is a personal work in progress that doesn't need any contributions at this time. I expect that to change as soon as a release version is available.

## Current version

### 0.0.3

- Navigation buttons on `Header.jsx` refactorized to `HeaderButton.jsx`. [Check out the component!](./src/v1/components/HeaderButton/HeaderButton.jsx).
- `NameBadge.jsx` has been created to display the owner's name in the header. [Check out the component!](./src/v1/components/NameBadge/NameBadge.jsx).
- First translation files have been created and integrated into `Layout.jsx`. [See Translations](./src/v1//assets/translation) | [Check the Layout component!](./src/v1/Layout/Layout.jsx).
- Added multiple fonts (I'll put the names and links to them in the next update).

**For previous versions, please refer to [PreviousVersions.md](./PreviousVersions.md)**

## Expected changes in the next version (AKA TODO)

- I'll add styles to common components like `Header.jsx` and `NameBadge.jsx`.
- `Header.jsx` content will show the translated data instead of just fixed text.
- Some new components will be created both in the layout and components folders.
- More info about the project here in the README.md.
